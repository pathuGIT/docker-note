# docker-note

This repository is my personal journey of **learning Docker step by step** and sharing the knowledge with others who are also beginners.

I am still learning and continuously updating this repo with:
- Basic to advanced Docker concepts  
- Practical setup guides  
- Real-world usage examples  
- Notes collected while experimenting  

🚧 Everything here is a **work in progress**, and it will grow as I learn more.
